# Book6-DLVR: Deep Learning Via Rust

This is a conversion of the GitHub repository [GitHub - RantAI-dev/Book6-DLVR](https://github.com/RantAI-dev/Book6-DLVR) into pure Markdown. The goal is to make the content easier to study, read, and improve. If you only want to read it in a browser, the authors provide a rendered version here: [Deep Learning via Rust](https://dlvr.rantai.dev/docs/deep-learning-via-rust/).
The conversion was aided by [GitHub - fillumina/hugo2md: Converts Hugo formatted files into markdown](https://github.com/fillumina/hugo2md).
