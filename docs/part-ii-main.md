**"*The thing that excites me most about deep learning is that it can handle complex data and learn from it, revealing patterns and structures that were previously inaccessible.*" — Geoffrey Hinton**

*Part2 of DLVR* is dedicated to exploring the core architectures that have driven deep learning’s evolution and success across various domains. This section begins with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), introducing their foundational principles and their role in image processing and computer vision tasks. It then progresses to modern CNN architectures, where cutting-edge designs like ResNet and EfficientNet showcase advances in efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. The focus then shifts to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), delving into their structure and application in handling sequential data such as time series and text. This is followed by an exploration of modern RNN architectures, such as LSTMs and GRUs, which address the limitations of traditional RNNs and extend their capabilities for long-range dependencies. The section bridges traditional architectures and attention mechanisms in self-attention on CNNs and RNNs, demonstrating how attention improves context capture in complex data. The journey continues with Transformer architectures, covering their revolutionary impact on natural language processing and their extension to vision and other domains. Part2 concludes with chapters on generative modeling, exploring Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for realistic data generation, Probabilistic Diffusion Models for controllable synthesis, and Energy-Based Models (EBMs) for flexible and interpretable data modeling.
