> **Note:**

*Part I of DLVR* serves as the foundation for understanding deep learning and its implementation using Rust. This section opens with an introduction to deep learning, offering a historical overview of the field, key concepts, and Rust's role in the AI landscape. This sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of deep learning techniques. The journey continues with Mathematical Foundations for Deep Learning, covering essential topics such as linear algebra, calculus, probability, and optimization—the mathematical backbone required for understanding and building neural networks. Neural Networks and Backpropagation introduces the fundamental building blocks of deep learning, explaining the anatomy of neural networks and the algorithms used to train them, with a focus on backpropagation. The section concludes with Deep Learning Crates in the Rust Ecosystem, showcasing the tools and libraries available in Rust, such as `tch` and `candle`, to effectively implement, experiment with, and deploy deep learning models.

### Notes for Students and Practitioners

<h4 class="text-primary">For Students</h4>

To fully engage with Part I, start by gaining a conceptual understanding of deep learning in Chapter 1, reflecting on its transformative applications and the advantages Rust offers in terms of performance and safety. Use this chapter to build excitement for the tools and techniques you'll explore in later sections. When diving into Chapter 2, Mathematical Foundations, dedicate time to mastering the key mathematical concepts presented, as they form the basis for every subsequent chapter. Practice translating these concepts into Rust code where possible, implementing small calculations like matrix operations or optimization algorithms to bridge theory and practice.

<h4 class="text-success">For Practitioners</h4>

In Chapter 3, focus on understanding how neural networks learn from data by exploring backpropagation and gradient-based optimization. Implement a simple neural network in Rust, practicing the forward pass and backpropagation steps to solidify your understanding. Finally, in Chapter 4, Deep Learning Crates in the Rust Ecosystem, experiment with libraries like `tch` and `candle` to familiarize yourself with the tools you'll use throughout the book. Implement basic models, experiment with the APIs, and observe how Rust enables efficient and safe deep learning implementations. By the end of Part I, you will have a strong conceptual and practical foundation to build upon as you delve into the architectures and advanced techniques presented in later parts of the book.
