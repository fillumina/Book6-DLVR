This book, *Deep Learning via Rust (DLVR)*, is an extension of the rigorous academic instruction provided in the Applied Deep Learning course at the Data Science Center (DSC) of the University of Indonesia (UI). The objective of this book is to equip students and practitioners with the most advanced and effective tools for deep learning training and deployment, ensuring they are well-prepared to address the increasingly complex challenges that define the frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

In our academic framework, Python has long been the cornerstone for implementing neural networks. However, recognizing the need for more versatile and high-performance solutions, we have introduced Rust as a complementary language. Rust is not only a powerful tool for hardware adaptation, but it also excels in parallelism and concurrency, critical components in the development of scalable and efficient machine learning models. Rust’s low-level capabilities allow students and professionals to engage directly with the hardware, optimizing their models for maximum performance. This makes it an indispensable language for those aiming to push the boundaries of high-performance computing.

Moreover, Rust holds significant promise in the emerging field of quantum machine learning (QML) and simulation. As quantum computing transitions from theoretical exploration to practical application, Rust’s capabilities make it an ideal language for developing the next generation of quantum-enhanced deep learning models. By incorporating Rust into our curriculum and this book, we are positioning our students to be at the forefront of these technological advancements.

This book is the result of a collaborative effort, with the RantAI team playing an instrumental role in transforming the teaching materials from the DSC into a comprehensive and practical guide. The *DLVR* book is designed to provide a thorough understanding of the fundamental, conceptual, and practical (FCP) domains of deep learning, making it an essential resource for anyone serious about mastering this field.

I invite you to engage with this book with an open and inquisitive mind. The journey through deep learning is challenging but immensely rewarding. My hope is that this book will not only enhance your technical skills but also inspire a deeper understanding and passion for the field. Embrace the complexities and nuances presented in these pages, and let them guide you toward becoming a highly skilled scientist and engineer, capable of contributing to the cutting edge of technology.
